# PippinAdapters

These may have concrete objects implementing the functionality directly, or if there is already a great 3rd party doing the job well, provide an adapter implementation to that dependency. Each adapter has a separate CocoaPods subspec. The following adapters for third-party frameworks are currently available:

- `Alerter`: [SwiftMessages](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages)
- `BugReporter`: [PinpointKit](https://github.com/Lickability/PinpointKit)
- `Logger`: [XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger)
- `ActivityIndicator`: [JGProgressHUD](https://github.com/JonasGessner/JGProgressHUD)
- `TouchVisualization`: [COSTouchVisualizer](https://github.com/conopsys/COSTouchVisualizer)
- `CrashReporter`: \*[Crashlytics](https://fabric.io)

The following hand rolled adapters are available:

- `Locator`: `CoreLocationAdapter` (and `CoreLocationSimulator`â€“wip)
- `Defaults` and `DefaultsKey`: `DefaultDefaults` and `DefaultDefaultsKey` (say _that_ fast five times)
- `Fonts`: `DefaultFonts` 
- `CrudViewController`: Create, read, update and delete from a data model using `UITableView`, `UISearchController` and `FetchedResultsController`
- `InfoViewController`: app name and version info, links to Two Ring Software properties (need to parameterize and extract to private shared repo), and buttons for more detail for certain components that may be present, like acknowledgements, bug reporting or in app purchases
- `FormController`: manage traversal and keyboard avoidance for a collection of inputs

> \*Crashlytics is a special case, because it delivers a static binary, which is disallowed in CocoaPods framework dependency chains. `CrashlyticsAdapter.swift` is delivered by the `PippinAdapters/Crashlytics` subspec, but it's not able to be built in the pod target due to the simple required `import Crashlytics` in that file. Whereas the other adapter subspecs declare dependencies on each related pod, you must specify `pod 'Crashlytics'` in your own Podfile and manually set a reference to `CrashlyticsAdapter.swift` from your app target at its location in the `Pods/` directory for it to work correctly.
